NetKit
======

An opensource simplistic PHP framework for rapid object oriented web site development

I created NetKit since I needed something that was easy to maintain and conforms exactly to what I need.
Used to use Zend framework before, but it was too bloated and I did not like the path that Zend was taking with ZF2.

Currently it is not very easy to set up a project from scratch without knowing what you are doing so it is not recommended
to already use this by yourself. I will be adding some help and documentation here later on but currently I need to focus
on some other projects.

A code editor for Mac to help with faster NetKit development will follow later as well ( Need to find some opensource editor for mac
that has the right feature set to build upon ).
